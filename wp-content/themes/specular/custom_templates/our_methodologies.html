<h2>The Power of Narrative Medicine</h2>
<div>
  Our methodologies are rooted in our study of Narrative Medicine, a field that explores the power of story-telling and self-narration in diagnosis and treatment of illness.  We have found the techniques of Narrative Medicine to be useful tools in our search to understand patient and HCP behavior, attitudes and motivations.
